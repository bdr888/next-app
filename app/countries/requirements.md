// Task Goal: Create a list of countries as well as some generic helper functions
// Use typesript to make all of the following requirements type-safe.

// Requirements:
// 1. Using the provided "countries.ts" dataset, load the data as if you were fetching it from an API and store it in state. (Mock API call)
// 2. Calculate the total GDP for each country in the dataset
// 3. Calcualte the average historical population for each country using their timeline
// 4. Find the country with the highest population in a given year, ex "2022" const [selectedYear, setSelectedYear] = React.useState(2022)

// 5. (Dicuss) how you would calculate the year with the highest global/combined GDP

// 6. Display the list of countries as a table/list. Each row should contain the name, population, gdp, newly calculated averages, and number of years of data
// 7. When clicking on a row, use state to select the country that was clicked
// Bonus / if time permits
// 1. Show or talk through how you would implement searching functionality
// 2. (Discussion) Talk through how you would implement pagination functionality to handle the dataset efficiently.
// 3. (Discussion) Talk through how you would implement sorting functionality to allow users to sort the table based on different attributes (e.g., population, area, GDP).
